## ðŸ‘‹ Hola, This is Me

I currently hold a position as an *Associate Professor* in the **Mathematics and Physics Department** at *[ITESO](https://iteso.mx)*, where I am lecturer and researcher on topics related to Machine Learning. Also I've started a nonprofit organization for Opensource projects in the Generative A.I. space, called [iteralabs.ai](https://www.iteralabs.ai). Have a background on B.Eng in Financial Engineering and M.Sc in Data Science, my work and research interests are mainly DeFi, Financial Machine Learning, Scientific Computing and later these days, LLMOps.

## ðŸ’¬ Current University Activity
- *Graduate Thesis Advisor* : Generative AI, Financial Machine Learning and Decentralized Finance
- *Head of Research Lab* : Decentralized Machine Learning Lab
